- inspired by extensible authentication protocol
- 3 participants p, s, and a and where p wants to authenticate itself to s who relays the required information to authentication service a
- no list of authentication methods but single one
- could be parametrised with more services for which this is used 
- encoding:
    done: 0
    login: 1
    register: 2
    confirmation: 3
    succ: 4
    fail: 5
- RCC takes an unusually long time, s_rcc.hes 14s
- Optimized RCC <2s  

Resolved Issues: 
- 3->4: password should not be updated but acknowledged by sending it or just "ack" back -> choosing confirmation
- check for user+password inequality should be OR not AND
- last messages should be forwarded to participant (that might be an option for a "mistake")
