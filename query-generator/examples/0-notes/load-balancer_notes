- inspired from CONCUR/CAV load balancer but refine to not use same worker twice
- trick for exiting: done=0 and workload>0
- reports "unexpected" with timeout 30s for c_scc twice
| c_scc_01.hes                   | 30.1955              | unexpected |
| c_scc_05.hes                   | 30.2063              | unexpected |
- s_rcc.hes takes unusually long, 8s -> 4s with simreach optimization
