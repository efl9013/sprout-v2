- inspired by https://github.com/sessionstar/oopsla20-artifact/tree/master/examples/PingPong
- changed to let a new participant c tell a how long each round has to be and C will be notified about new rounds
- changed use of labels
- encoding:  
    quit: 0
    round: 1
- needs more than 13GB RAM
- with merged clauses and unreach optimization, all except 2 scc queries go under 1s, the 2 scc queries timeout in over 1 minute
