- omitting some labels
- merged ends
- encoding: 
    no = 0,
    yes = 1, 
    ack = 2, 
    query = 3,
    bye = 4 
- ??
- needs more than 13GB RAM

removing loop + change quote default:
(0) c->a:m{m=3/\rq'=rq} (1)
(1) c->a:query{rq'=rq} (2)
(2) a->c:quote{quote>0/\rq'=quote} (0)

=> travel-agency-light

- removing register makes it implementable (11s check)
- removing constraint on rq>0 does not -> removed
- removing constraint on payment does not -> removed
- even introducing constraint that payment is 3 does not help
