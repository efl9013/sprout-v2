higher-lower-yes: The "most correct" version of the game, with the number of guesses tracked properly
HigherLowerYes: Cannot project onto A: cannot merge unguarded rec vars)

higher-lower-no: Incorrect because B does not remember the value of A's initial guess, and thus SCC is violated for state (3) for all outgoing transitions 

higher-lower-infinite: Incorrect because C can guess more times than the initially set number t by A, because looping does not decrement any value 
HigherLowerInfinite 

higher-lower-original: Incorrect because in addition to the above, A is informed about whether C needs to guess lower or higher in the loop, which defies the intent of the protocol

higher-lower-original-variation: The only change is to constrain t to be greater than n, so that C has a guaranteed winning strategy by just counting upwards from 0
