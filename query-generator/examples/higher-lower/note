higher-lower-yes: The "most correct" version of the game, with the number of guesses tracked properly
HigherLowerYes.scr: Cannot project onto A: cannot merge unguarded rec vars (OOPSLA'20)

higher-lower-no: Non-implementable because B does not remember the value of A's initial guess, and thus SCC is violated for state (3) for all outgoing transitions 

higher-lower-infinite: Implementable but has insufficient refinements, is the version of the protocol from ECOOP'24
HigherLowerInfinite.scr 

higher-lower-original: Implementable but A is informed about whether C needs to guess lower or higher in the loop, which defies the intent of the protocol

higher-lower-original-variation: The only change is to constrain t to be greater than n, so that C has a guaranteed winning strategy by just counting upwards from 0 
HigherLowerVariation.scr: 3m50s (OOPSLA'20)
